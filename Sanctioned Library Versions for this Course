bootstrap 3.3.7
jquery 3.1.1
angular 1.6.1
node 6.10.0

Anything else is WRONG unless you show a need.

But they updated the version, and I wanted to be on the 'latest and greatest'. That's a compulsion, not a need. It's an anti-pattern, and it's unprofessional. It will get you into trouble.

3 years ago, a Lehi company lost $200,000 from updating to the latest version.
I lost at least $10,000 a year for 8 years from employees with this compulsion.
Ask me in class if you want the details.
